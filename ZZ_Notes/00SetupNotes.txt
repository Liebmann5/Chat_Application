My 8080 localhost wouldn't ever pass any tests then I realized the page kept
loading this message

    EDB
    postgres

    Server is up and running.

Turns out I had a postgres server running there all the time. I also realized
this because I tried to submit URL while my server wasn't on and the tests
on FCC failed of course but when I went to reload the page there was no error
and the page still had that message which is when I realized 'postgres'.
Dumb crap!!
